# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.
## Steps for digging into an existing codebase
- View each lib file and rank them from bottom up (bottom being the base class, top being the class that utilizes all the other classes)
- Take an indepth look into each file from bottom up to see what each file is doing. 
- starting from the bottom open the file with it's spec file and and see what the tests are trying to accomplish.
- Run the tests from the bottom up and debug each. 

## What was hard about working with code you did not write?
- knowing were to start, but once I had a plan it was a little easier than I expected
